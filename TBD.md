## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- SQL
- Ruby
- Rails
- jQuery
- Javascript

## Hurdles

1) Creating a form using embedded Ruby to save items to database.
   No controllers were generated for the Tops table and Bottoms table.
   **Solution:** Used jQuery to get the needed values to perform post method.

2) User ability to save to the correct table (tops/bottoms).
   **Solution:** Used jQuery to get value from drop down menu. Passed the value
   to controller using params and implemented in conditional statement.
